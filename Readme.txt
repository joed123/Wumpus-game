Hunt the Wumpus is a game set inside the cave of the Wumpus. The player's goal is to guide an adventurer to kill the Wumpus, find its hidden gold, and escape alive. The Wumpus lives in a large cave of rooms arranged in a grid, where each room has four tunnels leading to the rooms to the north, east, south, and west. The adventurer starts the game in a random empty room in the Wumpusâ€™ cave. Her starting position is also the location of the escape route that she must use to escape afte grabbing the gold! Each room may be empty, or it may contain: two kinds of dangerous hazards, the terrifying Wumpus, and the gold treasure. The player wins the game if they can safely guide the adventurer through the cave to kill the Wumpus, pick up the gold, and make it back to the escape rope unharmed!
